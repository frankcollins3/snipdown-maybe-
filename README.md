# snipdown-maybe-
markdown file with code snippets 

# assumptions & supposings before asking chatGPT:
markdown and snippet file in one:
do the classic triple-ticker ``` & those lines become code snippets for javascript (or other code).
```
<h1> hello code </h1>
```

The "RealTime" conversion of those lines, technically:
from write: text
to now read: because written text === ``` { code } ``` // would need library-compiler | type checker to determine valid javascript 

would it be WYSIWYG app? 

file name:
.sd snipdown 

[WYSIWYG]
stock 10-50 lines to start maybe?
hit enter add a line
shift: curr_textLine increment every additionally encountered textLine.
snippets same textLine+[i] as shift: curr line + encountered line === code.true ? <code_not_text> : <text> for every encountered line
always text as params but is output text or code basically.
// open to using super simple library compilers which, never thought of it but would ../ take {code} as params type parse as JS compile render
